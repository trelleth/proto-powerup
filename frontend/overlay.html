        <li>You should only call t.overlay() as a response to a user action, such as clicking a button.</li>
        <li>Try to use t.popup() when possible instead of t.overlay()as it helps to better maintain context.</li>
        <li>When using an overlay, be sure to keep the user aware they haven't left their Trello board, and make it easy and intuitive to close.</li>
        <li>Try to get your overlay to load and render as quickly as possible.</li>
